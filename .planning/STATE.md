## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SQLite stays as primary DB, no PostgreSQL migration needed
- [Roadmap]: DV real-time path must remain synchronous in-process (P1 pitfall)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 (DV) and 4 (Optimizer) are independent but both need Phase 2
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Arbitration) requires both Phase 3 and Phase 4 complete
- [Phase 01]: Auth uses fp-wrapped Fastify plugin with preHandler hook for cross-cutting token validation
- [Phase 01]: WebSocket broadcast inline-removes dead sockets during iteration (no cleanup timer)
- [Phase 01]: Factory function pattern for module registry and event bus (composability over classes)
- [Phase 01]: BehaviorSubject for telemetry streams enables synchronous getValue() for DV real-time path
- [Phase 01]: Module interface contract: { name, requires, init(ctx), destroy() }
- [Phase 01]: HAL resolves profiles from hersteller/ directory via manufacturer name convention
- [Phase 01]: Modbus proxy uses pluggable setFrameHandler for processModbusFrame integration
- [Phase 02]: Async factory with dynamic import() for backend loading -- keeps unused backend out of memory
- [Phase 02]: getBackendInfo() is synchronous since it returns static metadata only
- [Phase 02]: Backend stubs throw 'not implemented' for fail-fast contract enforcement
- [Phase 02]: TimescaleDB policies use if_not_exists => TRUE for idempotent re-runs
- [Phase 02]: Used createRequire for pg import to support ESM context with CJS pg package
- [Phase 02]: DI via dbConfig._pool for mock-based unit testing without real database
- [Phase 02]: Batch INSERT limited to 500 rows (3500 params) for PostgreSQL param limits
- [Phase 02]: getBackendInfo() exposes walMode boolean for WAL verification in tests
- [Phase 02]: queryLatest scans all existing raw partitions DESC for most recent per key
- [Phase 02]: ensureRawTable caches known tables in Set to avoid repeated DDL per session
- [Phase 02]: _rollup_state table tracks last-rolled timestamp per resolution for incremental rollups
- [Phase 02]: INSERT OR REPLACE for idempotent rollup runs (safe to re-run)
- [Phase 02]: Config retention sub-object merges defaults with partial user overrides
- [Phase 03]: u16 uses Math.trunc + modular arithmetic matching gateway implementation
- [Phase 03]: Provider adapter pattern with factory function for composability
- [Phase 03]: processFrame is strictly synchronous -- no async boundaries in DV real-time path
- [Phase 03]: Modbus slave receives onWrite callback for signal delegation (not direct state mutation)
- [Phase 03]: Intent emitter uses priority 2 and source 'dv' for arbitration layer compatibility
- [Phase 03]: Routes conditionally apply auth preHandler for testability without mock auth
- [Phase 03]: DV plugin uses fp-wrapping matching gateway plugin pattern
- [Phase 03]: Lease timer uses unref() to prevent blocking process exit

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [P1]: DV real-time measurement path must not gain async boundaries during decomposition
- [P3]: Optimizer HTTP calls must never block the poll loop (fire-and-forget pattern)
- [P6]: Docker containers on Pi need CPU/memory limits and staggered optimizer runs
- [P7]: EOS/EMHASS APIs are evolving -- adapter layer with schema validation required
