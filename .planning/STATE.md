# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Completed 02-04 SQLite Rollup Engine

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SQLite stays as primary DB, no PostgreSQL migration needed
- [Roadmap]: DV real-time path must remain synchronous in-process (P1 pitfall)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 (DV) and 4 (Optimizer) are independent but both need Phase 2
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Arbitration) requires both Phase 3 and Phase 4 complete
- [Phase 01]: Auth uses fp-wrapped Fastify plugin with preHandler hook for cross-cutting token validation
- [Phase 01]: WebSocket broadcast inline-removes dead sockets during iteration (no cleanup timer)
- [Phase 01]: Factory function pattern for module registry and event bus (composability over classes)
- [Phase 01]: BehaviorSubject for telemetry streams enables synchronous getValue() for DV real-time path
- [Phase 01]: Module interface contract: { name, requires, init(ctx), destroy() }
- [Phase 01]: HAL resolves profiles from hersteller/ directory via manufacturer name convention
- [Phase 01]: Modbus proxy uses pluggable setFrameHandler for processModbusFrame integration
- [Phase 02]: Async factory with dynamic import() for backend loading -- keeps unused backend out of memory
- [Phase 02]: getBackendInfo() is synchronous since it returns static metadata only
- [Phase 02]: Backend stubs throw 'not implemented' for fail-fast contract enforcement
- [Phase 02]: TimescaleDB policies use if_not_exists => TRUE for idempotent re-runs
- [Phase 02]: Used createRequire for pg import to support ESM context with CJS pg package
- [Phase 02]: DI via dbConfig._pool for mock-based unit testing without real database
- [Phase 02]: Batch INSERT limited to 500 rows (3500 params) for PostgreSQL param limits
- [Phase 02]: getBackendInfo() exposes walMode boolean for WAL verification in tests
- [Phase 02]: queryLatest scans all existing raw partitions DESC for most recent per key
- [Phase 02]: ensureRawTable caches known tables in Set to avoid repeated DDL per session
- [Phase 02]: _rollup_state table tracks last-rolled timestamp per resolution for incremental rollups
- [Phase 02]: INSERT OR REPLACE for idempotent rollup runs (safe to re-run)
- [Phase 02]: Config retention sub-object merges defaults with partial user overrides

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [P1]: DV real-time measurement path must not gain async boundaries during decomposition
- [P3]: Optimizer HTTP calls must never block the poll loop (fire-and-forget pattern)
- [P6]: Docker containers on Pi need CPU/memory limits and staggered optimizer runs
- [P7]: EOS/EMHASS APIs are evolving -- adapter layer with schema validation required
