# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** Reliable real-time DV interface (measurement delivery, curtailment compliance) AND intelligent price optimization -- all from one box
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Completed 01-03 Device HAL and Modbus Proxy

Progress: [████████░░] 75%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: SQLite stays as primary DB, no PostgreSQL migration needed
- [Roadmap]: DV real-time path must remain synchronous in-process (P1 pitfall)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 (DV) and 4 (Optimizer) are independent but both need Phase 2
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Arbitration) requires both Phase 3 and Phase 4 complete
- [Phase 01]: Auth uses fp-wrapped Fastify plugin with preHandler hook for cross-cutting token validation
- [Phase 01]: WebSocket broadcast inline-removes dead sockets during iteration (no cleanup timer)
- [Phase 01]: Factory function pattern for module registry and event bus (composability over classes)
- [Phase 01]: BehaviorSubject for telemetry streams enables synchronous getValue() for DV real-time path
- [Phase 01]: Module interface contract: { name, requires, init(ctx), destroy() }

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [P1]: DV real-time measurement path must not gain async boundaries during decomposition
- [P3]: Optimizer HTTP calls must never block the poll loop (fire-and-forget pattern)
- [P6]: Docker containers on Pi need CPU/memory limits and staggered optimizer runs
- [P7]: EOS/EMHASS APIs are evolving -- adapter layer with schema validation required
